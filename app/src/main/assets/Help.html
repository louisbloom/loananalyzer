<h2>THE LOAN TYPES</h2>
<p>All of the loans are paid back at fixed intervals, at fixed amounts,
at a fixed interest rate. What varies between them is how the rate is
applied, if prepayments will save interest, or if they got rebate for
repaying before maturity.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Simple Interest Loan</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The rate is applied to what is left of the principal every amount
to determine the interest amount.</p>
<p><em>Prepayments will save you interest.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Rule of 78 Loan</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A <strong>precomputed</strong> loan with a rebate system called the &ldquo;Rule of 78&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The finance charge is the interest of a &ldquo;Simple Interest Loan&rdquo; for
its full term.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_78s">Wikipedia</a> for
further explanation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Precomputed Loan</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A <strong>precomputed</strong> loan with <strong>no</strong> rebate.</p>

<dt><strong>Principal Loan</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A <strong>precomputed</strong> loan with <strong>no</strong> rebate.</p>

<p><em>The rate may therefore seem unnaturally low.</em></p>
