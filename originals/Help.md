## DEFINITIONS

**APR**

:   An abbreviation for "Annual Percentage Rate" which is often the
    rate being the basis of the interest of a loan or the finance
    charge of a precomputed loan.

    The exception being the "Principal Loan" where the rate is not
    applied to the balance but the original principal.

    See
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate)
    for further explanation.

**EAR or EAPR**

:   An abbreviation for Effective APR which is the APR with fees
    included in the calculation.

    It will be calculated for all types of loans and functions as a
    rating.

    See
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate)
    for further explanation.

**Precomputed vs. Simple Interest**

:   A finance charge is calculated from interest costs, and possibly
    various other costs.

    This charge is added to the principal as the owed amount.

    See
    [DFI: Precomputed vs, Simple Interest Loans](http://www.in.gov/dfi/2602.htm)
    for further explanation.

**Rebate**

:   How much of the finance charge that will be rebated (forgiven) in
    the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon
    number of payments.

    See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_78s) for
    further explanation.

## THE LOAN TYPES

All of the loans are paid back at fixed intervals, at fixed amounts,
at a fixed interest rate. What varies between them is how the rate is
applied, if prepayments will save interest, or if they got rebate for
repaying before maturity.

**Simple Interest Loan**

:   The rate is applied to what is left of the principal every amount
    to determine the interest amount.

    *Prepayments will save you interest.*

**Rule of 78 Loan**

:   A **precomputed** loan with a rebate system called the "Rule of 78".

    The finance charge is the interest of a "Simple Interest Loan" for
    its full term.

    See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_78s) for
    further explanation.

**Precomputed Loan**

:   A **precomputed** loan with **no** rebate.

    The finance charge is the interest of a "Simple Interest Loan" for
    its full term.

**Principal Loan**

:   A **precomputed** loan with **no** rebate.

    The finance charge is the interest for its full term. The interest
    for the full term is the sum of the periodic rate applied to the
    original principal each period.

    *The rate may therefore seem unnaturally low.*
